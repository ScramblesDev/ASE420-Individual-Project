Code Smells
Hardcoded Data
In the old code, `english_words_set` was hardcoded within `password_generator.py`. This was refactored to allow more flexibility and easier updates.

Repetitive Code
The old version repeated the character set construction logic in `generate_random_password`. This was refactored to reduce repetition.

Lack of Modularity
Initially, all functionalities were embedded within two primary files. The refactoring introduced modular services, improving code organization and readability.

Bad Naming Conventions
The old code had some inconsistencies in naming (like the `use_advanced`). These were made more consistent in the refactored version.

Limited Functionality
The old version had limited functionality (like no custom character set feature). This was expanded in the refactoring process.

Lack of Input Validation
Initially, there was no robust input validation. The refactoring introduced better validation mechanisms.

Global Variables
The old code used global variables (like `english_words_set`). Refactoring encapsulated these within functions or classes.

Lack of Error Handling
The initial version had minimal error handling, particularly for user input. The refactored version improved on this aspect.

Direct User Input Handling in program Function
The initial code handled user input directly in `program.py`. This was refactored to separate input handling from the program logic.

Lack of Entropy Calculation
The old version did not calculate or display password entropy. This feature was added in the refactored code.


Refactoring Methods
Extract Method
Extracting specific functionalities into separate methods/functions for better readability and reusability (like extracting the password generation logic into different methods based on password type).

Module Extraction
Splitting the code into multiple modules (`services` directory) to enhance maintainability and modularity.

Rename Method/Variable
Renaming methods and variables to more accurately describe their purpose and improve code readability.

Parameterize Method
Changing methods to take parameters where appropriate, allowing more flexibility (like passing character sets as parameters).

Remove Magic Numbers/String
Replacing hardcoded values and strings with named constants or configurable options.
